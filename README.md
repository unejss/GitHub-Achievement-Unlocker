🤝 Pair Extraordinaire Achievement Bot

Automate GitHub contributions with a co-author to unlock the Pair Extraordinaire achievement.

This Python bot simulates co-authoring by continuously:

    Creating a new branch

    Appending to README.md

    Committing changes with a co-author signature

    Opening a pull request

    Merging the PR

    Repeating the process every few seconds

🌟 What It Does

    🔁 Auto-generates pull requests with co-authored commits

    🤝 Helps you and a friend (or alt account) unlock the Pair Extraordinaire badge

    🧪 Useful for testing co-authoring setups and GitHub workflows

    ⏱️ Sleeps between requests to avoid API abuse

⚙️ Setup Instructions
✅ 1. Create a Public GitHub Repository

    Name it test or any name you want.

    Ensure it has a main branch.

🤝 2. Add a Collaborator

    Invite your friend or secondary GitHub account to the repo.

    They must accept the invitation before running the bot.

🔑 3. Generate a Fine-Grained Personal Access Token

    Go to GitHub → Developer Settings → Tokens

    Click "Generate new token"

    Set Repository access to your test repo

    Set Permissions:

        All Permissions  → Read and Write

🛠️ 4. Configure the Script

Replace the following values in the script:

TOKEN = "YOUR GITHUB TOKEN"               # your fine-grained token
OWNER = "YOUR GITHUB USERNAME"            # your GitHub username
REPO = "YOUR TEST REPO"                   # your test repo name
FILENAME = "README.md"                    # file to modify

COAUTHOR_NAME = "YOUR FRIEND'S USERNAME"  
COAUTHOR_EMAIL = "FRIEND EMAIL ON COMMITS"  # must match verified email on GitHub

📦 5. Install Requirements

pip install requests

▶️ 6. Run the Bot

python bot.py

🧠 How It Works

    Uses the GitHub REST API to automate branch creation, file edits, PRs, and merges.

    Commits include the standard co-author signature:

    Co-authored-by: username <email>

    Each cycle appends a letter to README.md, creates a PR, and merges it.

💤 Delay and Retry Logic

    Sleep Time Between Cycles: 10 seconds (you can adjust it in time.sleep(10))

    On Failure: Waits 60 seconds and retries

🛑 Notes

    The co-author must have a GitHub-verified email that matches the one in the commit.

    This bot runs indefinitely — use Ctrl+C to stop it.

    Do not abuse the GitHub API; respect their rate limits.

🏅 Achievement: Pair Extraordinaire

Once you and your co-author make enough merged co-authored PRs, GitHub will award you the Pair Extraordinaire badge on your profile.
